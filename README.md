**README**

This is a very old project I did 5 years ago when I started learning Python. It is very incomplete and unfunctionnal. My goal is to completely rewrite it.

ComicReader is a python project that allows you to... read comics, having the png files of the differents pages.

After being re written, you will be able to read your comics by having the zip file containing all the pages. For now, this isn't implemented as this project is really unfunctionnal.
